The code contains two individual jupyter notebook (train.ipynb, transfer_learning.ipynb). The second code use transfer learning to do the contest. If you want to visualize the training process , you need to type `python -m visdom.server` to open visdom. Both codes can achieve about 90% accuracy on the validation set.
